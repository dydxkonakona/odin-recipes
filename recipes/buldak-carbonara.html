        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Buldak carbonara is a flavor of instant ramen from Samyang. It’s part of a ramen line that features super <strong>hot-n-spicy ramens</strong>. The buldak carbonara flavor comes in a pink pouch with a cute drawing of a hot chicken on it. I think the pink denotes the fact that it’s less spicy than the fire red 2x spicy buldak. Essentially, it’s a hot and spicy chicken ramen but with a carbonara-inspired sauce that is creamy thanks to the extra little packet of cheese.</p>
